This software dates back to the late 80s.  In late 2025
it was ported to use the curses library and get away
from directly interfacing with termcap.

A note on commit "types".  The unfortunately common practice
of embedding metadata about commits in the subject line of
a commit message (known as "conventional commits") is currently
very popular.  Its popularity only increases its ugliness.
Rather than succumbing to that nonsense (or perhaps this practice
is caving in), each commit has been given at least one "type"
trailer to indicate its purpose.  At the moment, these are:

tag:    type of commit:
----    ---------------
ini     initial cleanup work
fmt     code style or refactoring
ux      user interface
bld     the build system
doc     documentation
bug     trivial bug fix
ws      whitespace fix
k&r     fix old style prototype

Perhaps we should change the trailer name to "tag".
