D. A. Gwyn.  I have used his code for usleep() to get it to compile on
machines that don't have it.  Since the code is included in the FAQ
posted to comp.unix.questions I assume this is ok.  If someone knows
otherwise please let me know.

Kim Storm.  I used his nn code as a reference when trying to figure out
how to use the termcap library.
